# Hangman Game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game built with React and TypeScript. Players try to guess a secret word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. 

## Features

✅ Simple and intuitive interface<br>
✅ Randomly generated words for endless gameplay<br>
✅ Visual feedback on correct and incorrect guesses<br>
✅ Win and lose conditions with appropriate messages<br>

## Usage

- When the game loads, you'll see a row of underscores representing the letters of the secret word.
- Click on the letters to guess them.
- If the letter is part of the word, it will reveal itself in the correct positions.
- If the letter is not part of the word, part of the hangman will be drawn.
- Keep guessing until you either complete the word or run out of attempts.
- If you complete the word, you win! If you run out of attempts, you lose.
